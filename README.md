# Personal Finance Tracker

## Description

This project is a simple command-line personal finance tracker built with Python. It allows users to log their expenses, categorize them, and view detailed summaries by category. The goal is to practice fundamental Python programming concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, loops, functions, string operations, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and exception handling.

The program simulates a real-world task and demonstrates how to organize code into reusable functions while effectively using Python data structures.

## Features

- Add an expense with a description, category, and amount.
- View all logged expenses grouped by category.
- View a summary of total expenses per category.
- Input validation with exception handling for robust user experience.
- Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.
- Data stored in a dictionary, with categories as keys and lists of expense tuples as values.

## How to run

1. Launch the program by running the Python script.

2. You’ll be greeted with a welcome message and a menu presenting four options:
   - Add a new expense
   - View all recorded expenses
   - View a summary of expenses by category
   - Exit the program

3. To add an expense, select the corresponding menu option. You will be prompted to enter details such as the expense description, category, and amount. The program confirms once the expense is recorded.

4. You can view all expenses organized by category, displaying each expense’s description and amount.

5. The summary option shows total spending per category, helping you understand where your money goes.

6. When finished, select the exit option to close the program.

7. The program validates inputs and provides guidance if entries are invalid or empty, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Python Concepts Used

- Variables and data types (strings, floats, tuples, dictionaries, lists)
- Control structures (conditionals and loops)
- Functions for modular code design
- String operations and input handling
- Exception handling for input validation and error management
- Use of data structures: dictionaries to categorize expenses, lists for multiple entries, and tuples for expense records
- Command-line interaction
